# My-Dabbawala

<h2>1. Aim:</h2>
<b>
  The application is based around the required need for the user who wants to get their dabbas delivered to keep a record of all their orders as well as the dabbawala delivering that order. 
  The main ideology of  My Dabbawala is to combine technology with the trusted Dabbawala network to provide smooth door-to-door tiffin delivery. 
  This  application also helps users track and manage their tiffin delivery and  provide an option of one time delivery as well as delivery subscription packages.
</b>

<br>
<h2>2. Services:</h2>
In the application, a user will be provided with two types of delivery services. </br>
<b>1. One time delivery</b>: This is for users who require delivery of their dabba/tiffin on a particular day itself. </br>
<b>2. Subscription packages</b>: This will consist of various plans such as 3 months, 6 months, and a yearly plan which can be chosen according to the userâ€™s requirements. </br>
In both types, the user will have to enter the details like recipient name and contact number, the pick-up point and the drop-off point along with the timings. They then need to select a dabbawala from all the 
nearest dabbawalas available. After completing the payment, their delivery package will be confirmed and the Dabbawala will deliver the dabba everyday for the package chosen at the time provided.
